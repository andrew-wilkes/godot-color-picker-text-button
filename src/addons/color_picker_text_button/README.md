# Color Picker Text Button
Plugin for a custom node similar to the ColorPickerButton node but with a text label.

## Features of the button

* it uses a white style box that is modulated with the picked color
* the color of the text is flipped between a light and dark color to give good contrast with the background color
* the color picker is simplified by default, removing the sliders
* a tool script automatically copies the normal style and darkens the shade for the button states

## Usage

Activate the plugin in Project Settings.

After adding a ColorPickerTextButton node to your scene, you may customize the Script Variables in the Inspector panel. 

The label text is changed via the Text Value variable, and the Button text value is ignored.
